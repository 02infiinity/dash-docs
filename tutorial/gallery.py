    ## NYTimes Remake: Recession in 255 Charts

    321 lines of Python code.

    This Dash app was adapted from NYTimes's excellent
    [How the Recession Reshaped the Economy in 255 Charts](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/06/05/upshot/how-the-recession-reshaped-the-economy-in-255-charts.html).

    This Dash app is displays its content linearly, like an
    interactive report. The report highlights several notable
    views of the data and then invites the user to highlight
    their own regions at the end. This method of highlighting
    views is a great strategy for walking your readers through
    your complex analysis.

    The height of the charts was specified in viewport units (`vh`),
    scaling the size of the chart to the height of the screen. It
    looks great on monitors big and small.

    The text in the application is centered and its width is restricted
    to improve the reading experience. The graphs are full bleed:
    the extend past the narrow column of text the edges of page.

The Dash Userguide is hosted online at: [https://plot.ly/dash](https://plot.ly/dash).


### Contributing

PRs accepted! The Dash user guide is itself a Dash app. Each file `tutorial` represents a "chapter" of the docs. [`tutorial/run.py`](https://github.com/plotly/dash-docs/blob/master/tutorial/run.py) imports the chapters toggles them on and off with the radio button table of contents. `tutorial/server.py` is the entry point of the app.

Changes to master will get deployed automatically.

# Docs for Dash

https://dash-docs.herokuapp.com

Each file `tutorial` represents a "chapter" of the docs. [`tutorial/run.py`](https://github.com/plotly/dash-docs/blob/master/tutorial/run.py) imports the chapters toggles them on and off with the radio button table of contents. `tutorial/server.py` is the entry point of the app.

Changes to master will get deployed automatically to `heroku`.
